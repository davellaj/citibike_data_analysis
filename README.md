# Python For Data Analysis

After working with large data sets at my previous job using excel, I wanted to explore Data Analysis further using a programming language. I chose Python as my language for independent studies and over the course of a week learned Python while running small analysis to test my hypothesis that the most popular Citibike stations would be located further from a metro station.

# Data and API's Used

I have included the graphical output of all the scripts in this repository. If you would like to run the scripts on your own computer you will need Python 3.5 and the following packages:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplot](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pygal](http://pygal.org/en/stable/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

# Slides

The slides were used for a short presentation to my Thinkful BootCamp Cohort. It includes example Python code and comparisons to Javascript.
